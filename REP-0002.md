## Abstract

REP-0002 describes the process of moving the bridge into a standalone application on Ronin. This will allow the bridge to be operated by its own set of operators, instead of requiring validators to run it.

## Rationale

Currently, validators on Ronin are obligated to operate a bridge operator node, which leads to a close integration between the smart contract code of the bridge and the consensus code responsible for maintaining the validators and their delegators. This architectural approach introduces unnecessary complexities. Despite the significant efforts invested in securing the current design, the tight coupling of these components severely hampers the ability to implement enhancements or introduce new features. Therefore, in order to facilitate future improvements for Ronin, it is essential to decouple of the bridge from the consensus, effectively transforming it into a standalone application.


## Specification

With this upgrade, the bridge will have its own set of operators and the validators are no longer required to run bridge operator nodes. As a result, nodes do not need to relay the set of bridge operators on the Ethereum chain every day. Plus, unavailability bridge operator slash is modified and relaying slash is removed.

### Bridge operators selection

We expect to initialize the bridge operators with 22 operators. 12 out of 22 operators are the current governing validators, we are thinking some options fill in the remaining 10 slots as follows. 

- Snapshot the current standard validators 2 weeks before the hardfork.
- Having governing validators vote for the 10, the voting list include standard validators and validator candidates. 

This initialize set of bridge operators need to be approved (on-chain) by the governing validators.

### Bridge governance

All bridge operators will have the same power (there are no differences between governing validators and the remaining). Any operators can create a proposal to add a new operator, remove an old operator, or pause the bridge. A proposal is execuded if it get approved from 70% of operators.

### Rewards
- Currently, the rewards for bridge operators is funded by RON allocation rewards.
    - We allocated 1,000,000 RON for bridge operator reward in the first year (as we mentioned in the [our documentation](https://docs.roninchain.com/docs/basics/rewards)).
    - The rewards are automatically given to the bridge operators at the end of each period.
        - In each period, each bridge operator will be given a reward that is proportional to the number of votes in the period.
- After this period, we will need to find other source of rewards for the bridge operators. We are planing to introduce other types of rewards with the goal that the operators are profitable without receiving the fund from RON allocation rewards.
    - Fee for bridge transactions
    - Add other services such as random number generator, price oracle that can bring more profit to the operators.

### Slashing
Similar to the current design, the unavailability bridge operators are slashed. 
- There are two tiers for slashing.
    - Tier 1: If a bridge operator misses more than 10% votes in a day, the operator is penalized for 1 day, i.e., it doesn't earn the bridge reward on that day.
    - Tier 2: If a bridge operator misses more than 30% votes in a day, the operator is penalized for 5 days, i.e., it doesn't earn the bridge reward for the next 5 days.
- If a penalized bridge is slashed, the penalty will be stacked.
    - For example, if an operator gets tier 2 slashed on day 1, it will be penalized until day 5. Then, if the operator gets tier 1 slashed on day 2, it will be penalized until day 6. Finally, if the operator gets tier 2 slashed on day 4, it will be penalized until day 11.
- If an operator gets penalized for 30 days (e.g., at day 100, it is penalized until day 130), it will be removed from the operator set.

## Security

By moving the bridge to a standalone application, the consensus code of Ronin is significantly simplified. This simplification can save time and effort for future updates on Ronin. Moreover, it effectively minimizes the potential for introducing unforeseen security vulnerabilities, reinforcing the overall robustness of the system.
